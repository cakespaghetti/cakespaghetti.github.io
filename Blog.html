	<b><p>Ariana Venti Challenge </p></b>
	<p>Today we did a fun challenge in which Ariana Venti was missing. There were missing posters, sections of magazines, and fan complaints on the walls.
	First, we got a message from Michele Ohana, asking to check the dressing room outside the classroom. We found a ciper text, and beads in slime. We rearranged the beads several times to 
	find the key, which was "slime". Then, we used to Vigenere Ciper to decode the text. This exercise was really fun, since we all worked together and had a larger project on which to focus. </p>
