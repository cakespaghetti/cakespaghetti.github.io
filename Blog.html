	<b><p>July 19, 2018 - Ariana Venti Missing</p></b>
	<p>Today the instructors gave us an engaging challenge in which Ariana Venti was missing. When we walked in, there were missing person posters, sections of magazines, and fan complaints on the walls.
	First, we got a message from Michele Ohana, asking to check the dressing room outside the classroom. When we inspected the "dressing room", we found a purse
	with a ciper text. Upon returning to the classroom, we were given beads in slime. We rearranged the beads several times to 
	find the key to the ciper text, which was "slime". Then, we used to Vigenere Ciper to decode the text. This exercise was really fun, since we all worked together and had a larger project on which to focus. It was a
	real mystery, similar to the myster of the Flash's murder yesterday. It was a fun way to test what we knew. We were actually able to apply the things we learned to make for a great activity.
